\section{Emulator Tuning}

As part of training the emulator, \path{basicTrain} determines the hyper-parameters ($\Theta_k$ in Eq. \eqref{eq:hyperform}) to be used by the emulator. In many cases, these parameters are simply chosen \emph{ad hoc}, but \path{basicTrain} initializes them to reasonable values. To train the emulator, run the command

\commandline{basicTrain stat1}

When training the emulator, {\tt basicTrain} looks for parameters defined in a file named\\ \path{stat1/settings.dat}, which is a text file describing parameters used in the emulator construction and tuning and for the MCMC procedure. The file has a simple form, 

\begin{quote}
{\tt GPE\_USE\_EMULATOR\_ERROR false}\\
{\tt PCA\_PRINCIPAL\_COMPONENTS 6}\\
{\tt MCMC\_BURN\_IN 100000}\\
{\tt MCMC\_ITERATIONS 1000000}\\
{\tt MCMC\_STEP\_SIZE 0.1}
\end{quote}

\path{basicTrain} produces a file called \path{stat1/EmulatorState.dat}. This file has the following format:
\begin{quote}
{\tt SUBMODELS}~$M_Z$~~~$\leftarrow$Each principal component is modeled separately.\\
{\tt MODEL~~~0}~~~~~~~~~$\leftarrow$ The submodels are numbered zero through $M_z-1$.\\
{\tt COVARIANCE\_FUNCTION} {\it SQUARE\_EXPONENTIAL\_FUNCTION}\\
$\uparrow$ This describes the  functional form assumed by the GPE for the covariance.\\
The choice determines what hyper-parameters mean.\\
{\tt REGRESSION\_ORDER }~~ $\leftarrow$ Order of polynomial to fit to the model outputs\\
{\tt THETAS}~~~~~$\leftarrow$ Hyper-parameter values for this submodel\\
$N_\Theta$~~~~~~~~~~$\leftarrow$ This is the number of hyper-parameters\\
$\Theta_1$\\
$\Theta_2$\\
$\vdots$\\
$\Theta_{N_\Theta}$\\
{\tt END\_OF\_MODEL}\\
{\tt MODEL~~1}\\
$\vdots$\\
{\tt END\_OF\_MODEL}\\
{\tt MODEL}~~~{$M_z-1$}\\
$\vdots$\\
{\tt END\_OF\_MODEL}\\
{\tt END\_OF\_FILE}
\end{quote}\vspace*{-8pt}

The $\Theta_i$ values can be modified in these files to tune the emulator.

There are several supported choices for the \variable{COVARIANCE\_FUNCTION}. (Fill in equations from \path{stat.git/DistributionSampling/doc/CovarianceFunctions/CovarianceFunctions.tex})

\item \variable{SQUARE\_EXPONENTIAL\_FUNCTION}



\item \variable{POWER\_EXPONENTIAL\_FUNCTION}
