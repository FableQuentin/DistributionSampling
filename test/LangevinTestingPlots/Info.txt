SDX = Standard Deviation for parameter X in Gaussian Model

SDY = Standard Deviation for parameter Y in Gaussian Model

P = Prior ( P10 => Prior used = Mean +- 10 * StandardDeviation )

PolynomialModel1:
f1 = 0.75 * ( x - 3 ) * ( x + 5 )
f1_exp = -11
f1_cov = 2.5 
f2 = 1.5 * ( y - 4 )
f2_exp = 1.75
f2_cov = 0.15

PolynomialModel2:
f1 = same as above
f2 = same as above
f1_exp = 98
f1_cov = 13
f2_exp = 1.75
f2_cov = 0.01

NOTE: When plotting densities for the Gaussian Model, I always used
the Mean +- 3 * SD for the prior even when it was +- 10 * SD in the 
program since it only eliminated a bunch of "dead space".
